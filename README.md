Introduction

Our project aims to capture the users input and precisely calculate results based on their input combined with a selection of mathematical operations.


Use Cases

 In an attempt to demonstrate the multitude of uses for our application I will demonstrate an everyday task that can be aided by our softare. Consider a trip to the grocery store, you are surveying the goods available to you in the baked goods section. One too many cookies have caught your eye and you are worried about going over budget. Wouldn't it be convenient to have an application that is able to perform the math necessary to find the total of all of the items you currently have in your cart and find the amount you have left to spend? Well look no further, our proprietary software we call a "Calculator" allows operations on distinct values. It is as easy as following  the on screen prompt and entering values.
