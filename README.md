LICENSE: For our license we chose to use Apache 2.0 because it protects our work from being copyrighted while still allowing the community to expand on the project. It's also widely used and understood.
CODE OF CONDUCT: For our code of conduct we chose to use the preformatted Contributor Covenant conduct because it meets the needs of our project and includes important community safety guidelines that our class aligns with.
